WARNING!You’ll notice I’m using images here to show you what you should see. After
extensive testing it turns out that so many people have their computers configured to
not display utf-8 that I had to use images so you’ll know what to expect. Even my own
typesetting system (LaTeX) couldn’t handle these encodings, forcing me to use images
instead. If you don’t see this then your terminal is most likely not able to display utf-8
and you should try to fix that
